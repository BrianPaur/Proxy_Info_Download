2. creates folders based on company names from the ID file we define (will not overwrite already existing folders)
3. downloads glass lewis research, renames, and saves in correct folder
4. downloads the ballot list print page, renames, and saves in correct folder
5. downloads printed ballot page pdf from PE, renames, and saves in correct folder
